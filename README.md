# gym-cmapf

'gym-cmapf' is a [OpenAI Gym](https://github.com/openai/gym) environment for
multi-agent reinforcement learning-based algorithms.

The Connected Multi-Agent Path Finding problem is a variant of the Multi-Agent
Path Finding (MAPF) problem. While MAPF aims at generating collision-free
execution, CMAPF asks for connected execution.
